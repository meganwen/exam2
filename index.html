	<h1>Welcome to Juniper Lane swim club</h1>
	<p> Juniper Lane is the neighborhood club where family fun is #1!
            Whether you're looking for a place to take the kids, swim a few laps
            to stay in shape or just relax on a lounge chair with a good book - Juniper Lane is the place for you.
	</p>
	<p>
			The Juniper Lane Swim Club is a member owned non-profit, private swimming club located in Bridgewater, NJ.
            The club was established in 1955 but the facility was completely renovated just prior to the 2001 swim season.
            We maintain a membership of 180 families strong. Although we are currently at our maximum, we maintain
			a waiting list of families who are interested in joining the club. We are typically able to accommodate a
			number of new families each year through normal attrition. If you are interested in a JLSC membership or
			information please send an email to <a href="mailto:memberships@jlsc.org">memberships@jlsc.org.</a>
	</p>
	<p>
			We are located on Juniper Lane in Bridgewater Township, just off Country Club Rd about 1mi north of Garretson Rd.
